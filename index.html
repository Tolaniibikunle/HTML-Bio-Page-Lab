            My name is Tolani Ibikunle. I was born in Monclair, New Jersey. I then moved to
            Lower Merion Pennslyvania in 7th grade. I have always loved to play sports. I have two brothers.
            I am in the middle.  I went to Saint Joseph's Prepin Phiadelphia. I graduated from the prep and
            headed to Wake Forest Univeristy on an athletic scholarship. I played soccer there for 3.5 years, graduated early
            with an Economics degree and had the forunte of getting drafted to MLS. I played professional for a few years both here
            and overseas.  Now I am here at zipcode chasing a differnt dream!
